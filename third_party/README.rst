Cloned from https://github.com/google/googletest.git on 01/04/2018. At the time
of the clone, the ``master`` branch was at
``be6ee26a9b5b814c3e173c6e5e97c385fbdc1fb0``.

I copied the following files/directories from `googletest` in the repo clone
to the third_party directory under `googletest`:
  * ``include``
  * ``src``
  * ``LICENSE``

I ignored the rest of the cruft.
